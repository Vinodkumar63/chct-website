# Blumen Charity

The goal of this project is to redistribute surplus food and water to the individuals who are in need. If any event like a wedding or party has excess of food and water it will be collected from that location and distributed among the people who need it in the nearest area through our project. Thus this would prevent wastage of food and water and would also benefit the weaker section of the society who are unable to afford these meals.
